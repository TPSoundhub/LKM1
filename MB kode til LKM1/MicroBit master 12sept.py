# Basic event maker for LYDKit project P1 winter 2019. SSG, SHD, Herningsholm, Skanderborg - sponsered by Region MidtJylland
# Version 12 september 2019, Knud Funch SHD
# - Added basic filtering on accelerometer input - removing spike readings
#
# Version 9th september 2019, Knud Funch SHD:
#
# Send string "Hello world ..." on serial USB and make Happy face on LEDs when powerup
# Send characters on serial USB
# - "A", "B" when key a/b is pressed - plus "A" "B" on local display - Once pr press
# - "C" when pin 0 is activated - repetivive as long as pin 0 is active whith 500ms spacing
# - "0" - "9" randomly selected when pin 1 is active - repetivite 500ms spacing
# - "V" - when tilted to left   - repetitive 500ms spacing
# - "H" - When tilted to right  - repetitive 500ms spacing
# - "F" - when tilted forward   - repetitive 500ms spacing
# - "T" - when tilted backwards - repetitive 500ms spacing
#
# - Switch mode between sending on radio ws sending on serial when pin 2 is active
#    - small square followed by big square -> Radio tansmission
#    - big square follwed by small square -> Serial transmission
# If transmisson on radio then feedback on LED are in small letters "a","b" etc..
#     - and so is the character transmitted.
#     - Digits not transmitted so no action on pin 1 when in radio transmission mode.
# If anything is received on radio the received character is sent on serial USB. No feedback on LEDs
