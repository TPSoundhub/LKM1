# Basic event maker for LYDKit project P1 winter 2019. SSG, SHD, Herningsholm, Skanderborg - sponsered by Region MidtJylland
#
# Version 14 september 2019, Knud Funch SHD (used in HH - where tha one from 13th are used in SSG
# - Changed range in light measure for 'Day' to 40 to 180 instead of 50 to 150 as is seems to fit better 
#
# Version 13 september 2019, Knud Funch SHD
# - Added name for identification
# - Added light intensity reading. So Night, Day and sunshine can be simulated and used in project
#
# Version 12 september 2019, Knud Funch SHD
# - Added basic filtering on accelerometer input - removing spike readings
#
# Version 9th september 2019, Knud Funch SHD
# - first version with button and tilt plus radio.
#
# Microbit functionality in short:
#
# Send string "Hello world ..." on serial USB and make Happy face on LEDs when powerup
# Send characters on serial USB when sensors/buttons are triggered
#
# - "A", "B" when a/b key is pressed - plus "A" "B" on local display - Once pr press
# - "C" when pin 0 is activated - repetitive as long as pin 0 is active whith 500ms spacing
# - "0" - "9" randomly selected when pin 1 is active - repetivite 500ms spacing
# - "V" - when tilted to left   - repetitive 500ms spacing
# - "H" - When tilted to right  - repetitive 500ms spacing
# - "F" - when tilted forward   - repetitive 500ms spacing
# - "T" - when tilted backwards - repetitive 500ms spacing
# - "D" - when light intensity goes from outside range into range between 40 and 180. (Skift til Dag)
# - "N" - when light intensity goes from above to below 40.                           (Skift til Nat)
# - "S" - when light intensity goes from below to above 180.                          (Skift til Solskin>Dag)
#
# - Switch mode between sending on radio ws sending on serial when pin 2 is active
#    - small square followed by big square  -> Radio tansmission from remote location
#    - big square followed by small square  -> Serial transmission local connected via USB
# If transmisson on radio then feedback on LED are in small letters "a","b" etc..
#     - and so is the character transmitted.
#     - Digits not transmitted - so no action on pin 1 when in radio transmission mode.
#
# If anything is received on radio the received character is sent on serial USB. No feedback on LEDs
# Feedback is given on the remote MicroBit
#
# All characters are follwed by <name> for unique identification
